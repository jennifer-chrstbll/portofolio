        <strong>NCFI Prayers</strong><br>
        This project is a website built to serve as a digital platform for prayers and community sharing. 
        I contributed as the <strong>Lead Tester</strong>, ensuring the website ran smoothly, identifying bugs, 
        and verifying that all features met expectations. In addition, I supported the team as a 
        <strong>Backup Project Manager</strong>, helping coordinate tasks, manage timelines, and keep 
        the team aligned with project goals. I also actively participate in writing the documents needed such as the proposal.

        <strong>Automatic Attendance System</strong><br>
        This project focused on creating an automatic attendance system where a person could be marked 
        as present simply by walking past a camera, using recognition technology. I contributed by 
        designing <strong>use case and activity diagrams</strong> to clearly outline the systemâ€™s workflow 
        and make development easier for the team. I also played a role in the <strong>frontend development</strong> 
        of the website, ensuring that the interface was user-friendly and aligned with the intended system 
        behavior.
