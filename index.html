          <h1>Jennifer Christabelle</h1>
          <p>
            I am based in West Jakarta, Indonesia, and currently pursuing my career path as a Data Scientist. 
            With a strong foundation in informatics and a growing passion for data, I enjoy uncovering insights 
            from complex information and transforming them into meaningful solutions. I believe technology can 
            empower people, and I aspire to contribute by creating innovative and impactful digital tools. 
            Whether it’s working with data, building systems, or collaborating with others, I aim to grow, 
            learn, and help others through my skills.

          <strong>NCFI Prayers</strong><br>
          This project is a website built to serve as a digital platform for prayers and community sharing. 
          I contributed as the <strong>Lead Tester</strong>, ensuring the website ran smoothly, identifying bugs, 
          and verifying that all features met expectations. In addition, I supported the team as a 
          <strong>Backup Project Manager</strong>, helping coordinate tasks, manage timelines, and keep 
          the team aligned with project goals. I also actively participate in writing the documents needed such as the proposal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatic Attendance System</strong><br>
          This project focused on creating an automatic attendance system where a person could be marked 
          as present simply by walking past a camera, using recognition technology. I contributed by 
          designing <strong>use case and activity diagrams</strong> to clearly outline the system’s workflow 
          and make development easier for the team. I also played a role in the <strong>frontend development</strong> 
          of the website, ensuring that the interface was user-friendly and aligned with the intended system 
          behavior.
